## Introduction

Pagination is essential when dealing with large datasets to break data into manageable chunks and improve performance. This guide explains different methods for paginating datasets in Python, including:

    Basic pagination using page and page_size parameters.
    Pagination with additional metadata for enhanced navigation.
    Techniques for handling data deletion without breaking pagination.

## Features

    Simple Pagination: Uses page number and page size to slice data.
    Hypermedia Pagination: Adds metadata to each page, enabling better navigation and tracking.
    Deletion-Resilient Pagination: Ensures consistent pagination, even when items in the dataset are removed.

## Usage
#### Simple Pagination with Page and Page Size

Basic pagination works by specifying the page number and the number of items per page. The index_range function calculates the start and end indices for the dataset slice. Use it to display only the items for the requested page.
Example:

```python

# page = 2, page_size = 5
start, end = index_range(page, page_size)
page_data = dataset[start:end]
```

## Hypermedia Pagination with Metadata

Hypermedia pagination enriches basic pagination by adding metadata, such as total pages, current page, next page, and previous page URLs. This allows clients to access navigational details and manage pagination dynamically.
Example:

```python

def hypermedia_pagination(page, page_size):
    # Returns data and metadata about pagination status
    pass
```
## Deletion-Resilient Pagination

This technique ensures that pagination remains stable even if items in the dataset are deleted. By maintaining a consistent index or using unique IDs, deletion-resilient pagination prevents unexpected shifts in the dataset, offering users a stable browsing experience.
Example:

```python

def deletion_resilient_pagination(page, page_size, last_known_id):
    # Adjusts pagination indexes based on deletions
    pass
```
## Examples

Examples of each pagination type are provided in the repository, demonstrating how to retrieve, navigate, and display data while preserving pagination integrity.
